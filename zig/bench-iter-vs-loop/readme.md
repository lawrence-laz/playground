This is a test to see how a regular loop compares to iterator in regards to performance.

Seems like for a basic scenario both are identical:
```
loop:  Time (mean ± σ):      25.4 ms ±   0.3 ms    [User: 12.5 ms, System: 12.6 ms]
iter:  Time (mean ± σ):      25.2 ms ±   0.3 ms    [User: 12.4 ms, System: 12.5 ms]
```
