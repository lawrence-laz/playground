This is a test to see how a regular loop compares to iterator in regards to performance.

Seems like for a basic scenario both are identical:
```
loop:  Time (mean ± σ):       8.8 ms ±   0.2 ms    [User: 8.2 ms, System: 0.4 ms]
iter:  Time (mean ± σ):       8.8 ms ±   0.2 ms    [User: 8.2 ms, System: 0.5 ms]
```
